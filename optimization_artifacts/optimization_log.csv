Second, while 'Call for prayer', 'UN envoy urges troop withdrawal', and 'Aid worker reports rising displacement' are factually supported, the location for 'Call for prayer' is incorrectly listed as Amman, Jordan; the article states CAFOD (a UK-based NGO) made the call, and Amman is merely where the article was filed from — not the location of the event.

Extract only factually supported events directly stated or clearly implied in the text—no fabrications, inferences, or assumptions. Each event must include: precise geographic location (use the broadest accurate geographic term reflecting where the event physically occurred or had direct impact—never misattribute reporting locations, datelines, or bureau tags like “AP” or “CNS” as event sites; if an event spans a nation, use the national name, e.g., “Germany”; if localized, use exact place names like “Cotiporã” or “between Cotiporã and Bento Gonçalves, Brazil”; never use population counts or demographic descriptors as locations); severity (Critical for large-scale human suffering or systemic disruption—e.g., 85,000 deaths, €100M/day economic loss; humanitarian appeals are High severity only if tied to direct life-threatening conditions like mass starvation or disaster); and status (e.g., Ongoing, Resolved, Emerging). Events must describe tangible physical occurrences, human impacts, or infrastructure disruptions—never official statements, calls to action, appeals, metadata, or unsupported claims. If a death toll is reported, extract “High death toll” only if the number is explicitly stated; do not infer demographic specifics (e.g., “child mortality”) unless the text explicitly states children died. Never extract “Child mortality surge” or similar terms from total death tolls without explicit mention of children. If an appeal is made for a location but occurs elsewhere (e.g., “CAFOD called for prayer in Jordan for Yemen”), the event location is Yemen—the site of impact, not the reporting or issuing location. Consolidate overlapping descriptions (e.g., “power outage” and “electricity cut off” are one event; “transport strike” and “strike duration and impact” must be merged into a single event with attributes). Avoid vague labels like “War impact reported”—use precise event terms such as “Starvation crisis” or “Dam collapse.” Never extract institutional reports, cost estimates, analyses, or attributions (e.g., “German Economic Institute estimated...”) as standalone events—attach them as attributes to primary physical events. If a climate disaster or flood is implied by context (e.g., dam collapse, widespread flooding), extract it as a distinct event if supported by direct physical impact. If location is stated broadly (e.g., “southern Brazil”), do not over-specify to towns unless explicitly named as affected. Do not extract “Call for prayer” or similar NGO appeals as events unless they describe direct life-threatening conditions on the ground—such appeals are metadata, not events. Never infer status (e.g., “Ongoing”) unless explicitly stated or clearly implied by context (e.g., “continued for 35 hours” implies Ongoing; “dam collapsed yesterday” does not imply ongoing unless damage persists). All events must be distinct, non-redundant, and grounded in direct textual evidence—omit uncertain, misattributed, or derivative details."
