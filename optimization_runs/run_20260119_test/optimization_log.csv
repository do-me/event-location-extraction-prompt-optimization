The schema is correctly followed with all required fields present. The only minor issue is that the event 'Martin Griffiths urged troop withdrawal' could be more precise — the article states he 'pressed for' withdrawal, not 'urged,' which is a slight semantic inaccuracy. Additionally, the article mentions CAFOD's involvement and the context of the war lasting nearly four years, which could have been included as a supporting event but is not required in the schema.

The evidence snippets directly support the events. The schema is correctly followed. The only minor issue is that the location for the electricity outage is vaguely stated as 'near the dam site in southern Brazil' — the article does not specify the exact geographic scope of the outage, only that it affected nearly 300,000 residents, which could be broader than just 'near the dam site.'
