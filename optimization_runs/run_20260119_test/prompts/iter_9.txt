Extract only factually supported events from the text: precise location (use broad accurate geography—nation if national, exact place if local; never use reporting tags like “AP” or “CNS” as locations), severity (Critical for large-scale death/injury or systemic disruption; High only for direct life-threatening conditions like starvation or disaster), and status (Ongoing/Resolved/Emerging—only if explicitly stated or clearly implied by context). Events must describe tangible physical occurrences: disasters, infrastructure failures, human casualties, or direct impacts. Do NOT extract: official statements, appeals, metadata, attributions, estimates, demographic inferences (e.g., “child mortality”), or vague labels like “war impact.” If a death toll is stated, extract “High death toll” only if a number is given—never infer demographics. Location is the impact site, not the reporting source (e.g., appeal in Jordan for Yemen → event in Yemen). Consolidate redundant descriptions (e.g., “power outage” + “electricity cut” = one event). Never infer status or add unsourced details. All events must be distinct, grounded in direct textual evidence, and free of fabrication or assumption.
