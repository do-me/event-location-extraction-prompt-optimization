Must reflect the original wording or meaning without semantic distortion (e.g., 'pressed for' not 'urged'). Events must describe tangible physical occurrences: disasters, infrastructure failures, human casualties, or direct impacts. Do not extract official statements, appeals, attributions, estimates, demographic inferences (e.g., 'child mortality'), or vague labels like 'war impact.' If an event describes an effect (e.g., 'transport halted'), ensure it is grounded in a direct physical cause mentioned in the text."

Never use media outlets, organizations, NGOs, or reporting sources as locations. If the event involves an appeal or statement made by an organization (e.g., 'CAFOD calls for prayer'), the location must be the geographic area affected by the event being described, not the location of the speaker or organization.

Emerging: event is developing but not yet fully manifest, with explicit indicators (e.g., 'rising', 'escalating', 'expected to worsen').

If the event is a cost estimate or indirect consequence, the evidence must be the exact phrase stating the estimate or direct effect\u2014not supporting operational details.
