Must reflect the original wording or meaning without semantic distortion (e.g., 'pressed for' not 'urged'). Events must describe tangible physical occurrences: disasters, infrastructure failures, human casualties, or direct impacts. Do not extract official statements, appeals, attributions, estimates, demographic inferences (e.g., 'child mortality'), or vague labels like 'war impact.' If an event describes an effect (e.g., 'transport halted'), ensure it is grounded in a direct physical cause mentioned in the text. Avoid figurative language unless it directly corresponds to a measurable physical outcome (e.g., 'ground to a halt' is acceptable if supported by evidence of total disruption)."

Never use media outlets, organizations, NGOs, reporting sources, or speaker locations as locations. If an appeal or statement is made about a location (e.g., 'CAFOD calls for prayer for Yemen'), the location must be the geographic area affected by the event being described, not the speaker\u2019s location. If no tangible physical event occurs in a location, do not extract an event."

High: direct life-threatening conditions with explicit quantitative evidence (e.g., starvation affecting X people, acute medical crisis with quantified impact). Moderate: significant disruption without immediate life threat. Severity must be inferable only from explicit quantitative data or unambiguous qualitative indicators directly stated in the text\u2014never inferred from tone, context, attributions, or advocacy actions (e.g., 'calls for prayer' are not severity-worthy events). 'Immense suffering' alone is not sufficient for severity classification; it must be paired with concrete physical harm or displacement."

Completed: event has definitively ended with explicit end markers (e.g., 'lasted 35 hours', 'ended at 8 PM'). Emerging: event is developing but not yet fully manifest, with explicit indicators (e.g., 'rising', 'escalating', 'expected to worsen'). Status must be explicitly stated or logically deducible from clear temporal or directional language in the text\u2014no speculation, inference, or assumption allowed.

Subjective statements (e.g., 'We see immense suffering') are permitted as evidence ONLY if they are explicitly tied to a measurable physical event with direct quantitative support in the same sentence or adjacent clause (e.g., 'We see immense suffering due to 200 civilian deaths'). All evidence must be directly extractable from the text without inference, paraphrasing, or contextual embellishment.
