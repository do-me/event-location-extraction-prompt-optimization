Must reflect the original wording or meaning without semantic distortion (e.g., 'pressed for' not 'urged'). Events must describe tangible physical occurrences: disasters, infrastructure failures, human casualties, or direct impacts. Do not extract official statements, appeals, attributions, estimates, demographic inferences (e.g., 'child mortality'), or vague labels like 'war impact.' If an event describes an effect (e.g., 'transport halted'), ensure it is grounded in a direct physical cause mentioned in the text. Avoid figurative language unless it directly corresponds to a measurable physical outcome (e.g., 'ground to a halt' is acceptable if supported by evidence of total disruption)."

Never use media outlets, organizations, NGOs, reporting sources, or speaker locations as locations. If an appeal or statement is made about a location (e.g., 'CAFOD calls for prayer for Yemen'), the location must be the geographic area affected by the event being described, not the speaker\u2019s location.

High: direct life-threatening conditions with explicit evidence (e.g., starvation, acute medical crisis with quantified impact). Moderate: significant disruption without immediate life threat. Severity must be inferable only from explicit quantitative data or unambiguous qualitative indicators directly stated in the text\u2014never inferred from tone, context, attributions, or advocacy actions (e.g., 'calls for prayer' are not severity-worthy events). When 'immense suffering' is paired with documented human casualties or mass displacement, classify as Critical. 'Immense suffering' alone is not sufficient for severity classification."

Emerging: event is developing but not yet fully manifest, with explicit indicators (e.g., 'rising', 'escalating', 'expected to worsen'). Status must be explicitly stated or logically deducible from clear temporal or directional language in the text\u2014no speculation allowed."
